life cycle:

Mounting:
print statements inside code: and flow goes like this
inside constructor-  method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated
inside componentWillMount: method is called right before the render method:
inside render: method is required, and is the method that actual outputs HTML to the DOM.
inside componentDidMount: method is called after the component is rendered(to mount the details)
After componentDidMount  render will be called again.

Update:
